# Freyja

General-purpose agent orchestrator built on [Deep Agents](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/deepagents/overview) and served with FastAPI. The orchestrator routes work to the right delegate agent and keeps a human in the loop for any action with effects outside its workspace.

## Setup

```bash
uv sync                         # creates .venv and installs runtime + dev dependencies
cp .env.example .env            # pick one model block and set its key; leave the database line as is
docker compose up -d postgres   # local Postgres; its credentials equal FREYJA_DATABASE_URI in .env.example
uv run pre-commit install       # one-time per clone: runs Ruff and the unit tests on every commit
```

`.env` is git-ignored. The compose file and `.env.example` carry the same local-only database credentials, so the copied file connects without edits; only the model key needs filling in.

## Run the dev server

With auto-reload, listening on `127.0.0.1:8000`:

```bash
uv run --env-file .env uvicorn freyja_agent.api.app:app --reload
```

Or through the console script, which reads the bind address from settings:

```bash
uv run --env-file .env freyja-api
```

Startup opens one Postgres connection pool and creates the LangGraph checkpointer and store tables plus the `freyja_run_locks` table if they are missing. If the database cannot be reached, startup fails with an error that names the connection (password redacted) and the process exits instead of serving.

Check it is up:

```bash
curl localhost:8000/healthz
# {"status":"ok"}
```

Interactive API docs are at <http://localhost:8000/docs>. There is no authentication: anyone who can reach the port acts as a user, which is why the server binds `127.0.0.1` by default.

## Use the API

A thread is a conversation keyed by a client-chosen id (1 to 128 characters: letters, digits, hyphen, underscore, dot). Three endpoints work on it. The full contracts are in `specs/001-thread-runs-api/contracts/`.

**Start a run** and stream it as server-sent events:

```bash
curl -N -X POST localhost:8000/threads/demo-1/runs \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"message": "Summarize what you can do and which skills you have loaded."}'
```

Each event has an `event:` line naming its kind and a `data:` line holding one JSON object. The first event is always `start`. Then come `update` (one per orchestrator step, with messages, tool calls, and tool results), `message` (the reply as it is produced), and, with `?debug=true`, `debug` (raw LangGraph detail; it never changes the run). Exactly one terminal event closes the stream: `end` when the reply is finished, `interrupt` when the orchestrator proposes an action that needs approval, or `error` with a `code` of `step_limit`, `model_error`, or `internal`. A later message to the same thread continues the conversation, including after a service restart.

One run per thread: a second run while one streams gets `409` with code `run_active`. The marker is a lease in the database, so it holds across service instances and expires after `FREYJA_RUN_LOCK_TTL_SECONDS` if the instance holding it dies.

**Read a thread's state**: the full transcript in order, whether a run is active, and the pending proposal if the thread is paused. A never-used id is `404`.

```bash
curl -s localhost:8000/threads/demo-1/state | jq
```

**Decide on a proposal.** The only action with an effect outside the workspace is `send_notification`, a placeholder that writes one log line. When the orchestrator proposes it, the stream ends with `interrupt` listing the proposed arguments, and the thread stays paused until a decision arrives, however long that takes. A new message on a paused thread is refused with `409` and code `decision_pending`. Resume with one decision per proposed action, in order, and the continuation streams with the same event kinds as a run:

```bash
curl -N -X POST localhost:8000/threads/demo-1/resume \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"decisions": [{"type": "approve"}]}'
# or edit the arguments: {"decisions": [{"type": "edit", "args": {"channel": "#ops-staging", "message": "..."}}]}
# or reject with an optional reason: {"decisions": [{"type": "reject", "message": "Not needed."}]}
```

The tool runs only after a recorded approve or edit. An edit keeps the action and replaces its arguments, validated against the tool's schema; the original proposal stays in the transcript and the tool result records that a person changed it. A reject skips the tool and the orchestrator is told why. Resume on a thread with nothing pending is `409` with code `nothing_pending`; a malformed decision is `422` and the proposal stays decidable.

## Lint and format

Ruff handles both linting and formatting. Configuration lives in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.ruff]`.

```bash
uv run ruff check .            # lint
uv run ruff check . --fix      # lint and apply safe autofixes
uv run ruff format .           # format in place
uv run ruff format --check .   # report unformatted files without changing them (CI mode)
```

The pre-commit hook runs `ruff check --fix` and `ruff format` on staged files, then the unit test suite. If Ruff changes a file, the commit is blocked: re-stage the file and commit again. If a test fails, the commit is blocked until it passes. To run the hook over the whole repo:

```bash
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Unit tests

```bash
uv run pytest                  # full suite
uv run pytest -q               # quiet output
uv run pytest tests/test_health.py::test_healthz   # a single test
```

Tests live in `tests/`. The suite runs the production routes through FastAPI's test client with in-memory persistence and a scripted model, so it needs neither a database nor a model provider.

The Postgres integration tests under `tests/integration/` are skipped unless `FREYJA_TEST_DATABASE_URI` names a database that may be wiped. Create it once in the compose container, then run them:

```bash
docker compose exec postgres createdb -U freyja freyja_test
FREYJA_TEST_DATABASE_URI=postgresql://freyja:freyja@localhost:5432/freyja_test uv run pytest tests/integration
```

## Configuration

Settings are read from `FREYJA_*` environment variables by `src/freyja_agent/config.py`. Load them with `uv run --env-file .env <command>`.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `FREYJA_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address for `freyja-api`. Containers set `0.0.0.0`. |
| `FREYJA_PORT` | `8000` | Bind port for `freyja-api`. |
| `FREYJA_DATABASE_URI` | none, required | Postgres connection for the checkpointer, store, and run locks. No default because it carries credentials; `.env.example` has the value the compose container uses. |
| `FREYJA_MODEL` | `anthropic:claude-sonnet-5-5` | Model for the orchestrator, as a LangChain `provider:model` string. Installed providers: `openai`, `anthropic`, `openrouter`. |
| `FREYJA_WORKSPACE_DIR` | `workspace` | Root of the orchestrator's file tools. `skills/` inside it is committed source; `cases/` is written at runtime and git-ignored. |
| `FREYJA_MAX_STEPS` | `50` | Maximum orchestrator steps per run. Reaching it ends the run with an `error` event of code `step_limit`; the thread stays usable. |
| `FREYJA_RUN_LOCK_TTL_SECONDS` | `60` | Expiry of the per-thread run lease. A run renews it while streaming; a crashed instance frees its threads after this long. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_BASE` | | Key for `openai:` models. `OPENAI_API_BASE` is optional: set it for self-hosted OpenAI-compatible servers or to route through a gateway. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_URL` | | Key for `anthropic:` models. `ANTHROPIC_API_URL` is optional: set it to route through a gateway. |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_BASE` | | Key for `openrouter:` models; the model id is OpenRouter's slug. `OPENROUTER_API_BASE` is optional: set it to route through a proxy. |

`FREYJA_TEST_DATABASE_URI` is not a setting: it is read only by the integration tests, as described above.

## Spec Kit workflow

Features are built with [Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit). Each step is a skill run inside a coding agent: Claude Code invokes them as `/speckit-<step>`, Codex CLI as `$speckit-<step>`. A human reviews every step's output in a pull request before the next step runs, and commits stay manual with the `type: summary` form.

Spec Kit finds the current feature through `.specify/feature.json`, which is git-ignored and written by `specify`. Check it before any step when more than one feature exists:

```bash
cat .specify/feature.json
# {"feature_directory": "specs/001-thread-runs-api"}
```

The constitution in `.specify/memory/constitution.md` was written once with `/speckit-constitution` and is amended through a pull request that bumps its version.

The artifacts cross-reference each other with short ids: `FR-###` is a functional requirement and `SC-###` a success criterion in `spec.md`, `US#` a user story, `R#` a decision in `research.md`, and `T###` a task in `tasks.md`. A task that says `(FR-006, R7)` implements that requirement following that research decision, which is how a reviewer traces any line of code back to the spec. The analyze step's report, which is printed rather than saved, numbers its findings by category: `I1` is the first inconsistency, `C1` the first coverage gap, `A1` the first ambiguity, `U1` underspecification, `D1` duplication.

### Before every step: recreate the feature branch

Pull requests are squash-merged and the branch is deleted on merge. That means **after every merge, the feature branch you were on no longer exists**, and the next step must not run on `main` or on a stale local branch. Before each step below, run:

```bash
git switch main && git pull
git switch -c 001-thread-runs-api
```

Skipping this is the most common mistake. The symptoms: a step writes files on `main`, a push is rejected because the remote branch is gone, or a PR shows commits from an earlier step that was already merged. If `git status` does not show a clean tree on a branch that was just created from the latest `main`, stop and fix that first.

The first step, specify, is the one exception: its git hook creates the branch for you.

### One feature, end to end

**1. Specify.** Describe the feature in one paragraph. The git extension creates the numbered branch, and the skill writes `specs/001-thread-runs-api/spec.md` plus a quality checklist.

```text
/speckit-specify Thread runs API: the minimal runtime. POST /threads/{thread_id}/runs accepts a
message and streams the run over SSE ... Out of scope: delegate agents, authentication.
```

Review `spec.md`, then commit and open the PR:

```bash
git add specs && git commit -m "docs: add thread runs API spec (001)"
git push -u origin 001-thread-runs-api && gh pr create --base main
```

Merge it. **Recreate the branch** before step 2.

**2. Clarify** (optional gate). Asks up to five questions about underspecified areas and writes the answers back into `spec.md` under a `## Clarifications` section.

```text
/speckit-clarify
```

Commit as `docs: clarify thread runs API spec (001)`, open a PR, merge. **Recreate the branch** before step 3.

**3. Plan.** Reads the spec and the constitution and writes `plan.md`, `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, and `quickstart.md`. Check the plan's Constitution Check names the principles it touches.

```text
/speckit-plan
```

Commit as `docs: plan thread runs API (001)`, PR, merge. **Recreate the branch** before step 4.

**4. Tasks.** Writes `tasks.md`: setup, foundational, one phase per user story, polish, with `[P]` on tasks that can run in parallel.

```text
/speckit-tasks
```

Commit as `docs: add thread runs API tasks (001)`, PR, merge. **Recreate the branch** before step 5.

**5. Analyze** (optional gate). Read-only cross-check of spec, plan, and tasks: coverage gaps, contradictions, constitution conflicts. Fix what it finds by editing the files, then commit as `docs: reconcile spec, plan, and tasks after analysis (001)`, PR, merge. **Recreate the branch** before step 6.

```text
/speckit-analyze
```

**6. Implement.** Works through `tasks.md` phase by phase, ticking tasks as they pass. Stop at a phase checkpoint to review and ship, then continue:

```text
/speckit-implement Stop after Phase 2 (Foundational). Do not start Phase 3.
```

Each phase becomes its own pull request with a `feat:` message, for example `feat: runtime foundation for thread runs (001, phases 1-2)`. After it merges, **recreate the branch** before continuing with the next phase. Before the PR: `uv run pytest`, `uv run ruff check .`, `uv run ruff format --check .`, and the checkpoint in `tasks.md` for that phase.

**7. Converge.** After the last phase, compares the code against the spec, plan, and tasks and appends any unbuilt work to `tasks.md` so one more implement pass can finish it.

```text
/speckit-converge
```

### Codex CLI

The same skills live under `.agents/skills/` for Codex CLI, installed with `specify integration install codex`. Replace `/speckit-<step>` with `$speckit-<step>`; everything else, including the branch and PR routine, is identical.
