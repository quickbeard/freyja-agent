# Freyja

General-purpose agent orchestrator built on [Deep Agents](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/deepagents/overview) and served with FastAPI. The orchestrator routes work to the right delegate agent and keeps a human in the loop for any action with effects outside its workspace.

## Setup

```bash
uv sync                     # creates .venv and installs runtime + dev dependencies
cp .env.example .env        # fill in values as needed; .env is git-ignored
uv run pre-commit install   # one-time per clone: runs Ruff and the unit tests on every commit
```

## Run the dev server

With auto-reload, listening on `127.0.0.1:8000`:

```bash
uv run --env-file .env uvicorn freyja_agent.api.app:app --reload
```

Or through the console script, which reads the bind address from settings:

```bash
uv run --env-file .env freyja-api
```

Check it is up:

```bash
curl localhost:8000/healthz
# {"status":"ok"}
```

Interactive API docs are at <http://localhost:8000/docs>.

## Lint and format

Ruff handles both linting and formatting. Configuration lives in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.ruff]`.

```bash
uv run ruff check .            # lint
uv run ruff check . --fix      # lint and apply safe autofixes
uv run ruff format .           # format in place
uv run ruff format --check .   # report unformatted files without changing them (CI mode)
```

The pre-commit hook runs `ruff check --fix` and `ruff format` on staged files, then the unit test suite. If Ruff changes a file, the commit is blocked: re-stage the file and commit again. If a test fails, the commit is blocked until it passes. To run the hook over the whole repo:

```bash
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Unit tests

```bash
uv run pytest                  # full suite
uv run pytest -q               # quiet output
uv run pytest tests/test_health.py::test_healthz   # a single test
```

Tests live in `tests/`. The health test uses FastAPI's test client without starting a server.

## Configuration

Settings are read from `FREYJA_*` environment variables by `src/freyja_agent/config.py`. Load them with `uv run --env-file .env <command>`.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `FREYJA_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address for `freyja-api`. Containers set `0.0.0.0`. |
| `FREYJA_PORT` | `8000` | Bind port for `freyja-api`. |
| `FREYJA_DATABASE_URI` | none, required | Postgres connection for the checkpointer and store (wiring in progress). No default because it carries credentials; `.env.example` has the local container value. |
| `FREYJA_MODEL` | `anthropic:claude-sonnet-5-5` | Model for the orchestrator (wiring in progress), as a LangChain `provider:model` string. Installed providers: `openai`, `anthropic`, `openrouter`. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_BASE` | | Key for `openai:` models. `OPENAI_API_BASE` is optional: set it for self-hosted OpenAI-compatible servers or to route through a gateway. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_URL` | | Key for `anthropic:` models. `ANTHROPIC_API_URL` is optional: set it to route through a gateway. |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_BASE` | | Key for `openrouter:` models; the model id is OpenRouter's slug. `OPENROUTER_API_BASE` is optional: set it to route through a proxy. |

## Spec Kit workflow

Features are built with [Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit). Each step is a skill run inside a coding agent: Claude Code invokes them as `/speckit-<step>`, Codex CLI as `$speckit-<step>`. A human reviews every step's output in a pull request before the next step runs, and commits stay manual with the `type: summary` form.

Spec Kit finds the current feature through `.specify/feature.json`, which is git-ignored and written by `specify`. Check it before any step when more than one feature exists:

```bash
cat .specify/feature.json
# {"feature_directory": "specs/001-thread-runs-api"}
```

The constitution in `.specify/memory/constitution.md` was written once with `/speckit-constitution` and is amended through a pull request that bumps its version.

The artifacts cross-reference each other with short ids: `FR-###` is a functional requirement and `SC-###` a success criterion in `spec.md`, `US#` a user story, `R#` a decision in `research.md`, and `T###` a task in `tasks.md`. A task that says `(FR-006, R7)` implements that requirement following that research decision, which is how a reviewer traces any line of code back to the spec. The analyze step's report, which is printed rather than saved, numbers its findings by category: `I1` is the first inconsistency, `C1` the first coverage gap, `A1` the first ambiguity, `U1` underspecification, `D1` duplication.

### Before every step: recreate the feature branch

Pull requests are squash-merged and the branch is deleted on merge. That means **after every merge, the feature branch you were on no longer exists**, and the next step must not run on `main` or on a stale local branch. Before each step below, run:

```bash
git switch main && git pull
git switch -c 001-thread-runs-api
```

Skipping this is the most common mistake. The symptoms: a step writes files on `main`, a push is rejected because the remote branch is gone, or a PR shows commits from an earlier step that was already merged. If `git status` does not show a clean tree on a branch that was just created from the latest `main`, stop and fix that first.

The first step, specify, is the one exception: its git hook creates the branch for you.

### One feature, end to end

**1. Specify.** Describe the feature in one paragraph. The git extension creates the numbered branch, and the skill writes `specs/001-thread-runs-api/spec.md` plus a quality checklist.

```text
/speckit-specify Thread runs API: the minimal runtime. POST /threads/{thread_id}/runs accepts a
message and streams the run over SSE ... Out of scope: delegate agents, authentication.
```

Review `spec.md`, then commit and open the PR:

```bash
git add specs && git commit -m "docs: add thread runs API spec (001)"
git push -u origin 001-thread-runs-api && gh pr create --base main
```

Merge it. **Recreate the branch** before step 2.

**2. Clarify** (optional gate). Asks up to five questions about underspecified areas and writes the answers back into `spec.md` under a `## Clarifications` section.

```text
/speckit-clarify
```

Commit as `docs: clarify thread runs API spec (001)`, open a PR, merge. **Recreate the branch** before step 3.

**3. Plan.** Reads the spec and the constitution and writes `plan.md`, `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, and `quickstart.md`. Check the plan's Constitution Check names the principles it touches.

```text
/speckit-plan
```

Commit as `docs: plan thread runs API (001)`, PR, merge. **Recreate the branch** before step 4.

**4. Tasks.** Writes `tasks.md`: setup, foundational, one phase per user story, polish, with `[P]` on tasks that can run in parallel.

```text
/speckit-tasks
```

Commit as `docs: add thread runs API tasks (001)`, PR, merge. **Recreate the branch** before step 5.

**5. Analyze** (optional gate). Read-only cross-check of spec, plan, and tasks: coverage gaps, contradictions, constitution conflicts. Fix what it finds by editing the files, then commit as `docs: reconcile spec, plan, and tasks after analysis (001)`, PR, merge. **Recreate the branch** before step 6.

```text
/speckit-analyze
```

**6. Implement.** Works through `tasks.md` phase by phase, ticking tasks as they pass. Stop at a phase checkpoint to review and ship, then continue:

```text
/speckit-implement Stop after Phase 2 (Foundational). Do not start Phase 3.
```

Each phase becomes its own pull request with a `feat:` message, for example `feat: runtime foundation for thread runs (001, phases 1-2)`. After it merges, **recreate the branch** before continuing with the next phase. Before the PR: `uv run pytest`, `uv run ruff check .`, `uv run ruff format --check .`, and the checkpoint in `tasks.md` for that phase.

**7. Converge.** After the last phase, compares the code against the spec, plan, and tasks and appends any unbuilt work to `tasks.md` so one more implement pass can finish it.

```text
/speckit-converge
```

### Codex CLI

The same skills live under `.agents/skills/` for Codex CLI, installed with `specify integration install codex`. Replace `/speckit-<step>` with `$speckit-<step>`; everything else, including the branch and PR routine, is identical.
